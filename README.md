## Features
- Personal assistant (small project)
- Greets user depending on time of day (I should add an option that lets you input your name).
- Asks the user for options and performs them.
- Speech recognition hasn't been used here as in the original tutorial but should be implemented later.
- [Used FreeCodeCamp Tutorial with changes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-project-how-to-build-your-own-jarvis-using-python/)
