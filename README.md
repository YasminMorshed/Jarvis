## Features
- Personal assistant project
- Speech recognition hasn't been used here as in the original tutorial but should be implemented later
- Future features to implement: Speech recognition as mentioned above and maybe considering different accents, we have to look at the error rates as well. Conversation could be implemented. (Inspirations from ML for Audio Study Group session 1, Hugging Face).
- [Used FreeCodeCamp Tutorial with changes](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-project-how-to-build-your-own-jarvis-using-python/)
